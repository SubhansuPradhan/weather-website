# Weather‑Website

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This web application provides users with real‑time weather information for cities around the world. Users can search for a location and instantly view current conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation chances and more.

## 🎯 Features  
- Search for any city (and optionally country) to get its weather status.  
- Displays key weather parameters: temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, weather description.  
- Responsive design — works on desktop and mobile.  
- Clean UI that focuses solely on weather data (no ads/pop‑ups).  
- Powered by an external weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or similar).

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)  
- **API**: Weather data fetched via REST API from a weather‑provider  
- **Additional assets**: Weather icons/GIFs to visually represent conditions  
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel  
- **File organization**: Typical root has `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, assets/images folder etc.

## ✅ Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhansuPradhan/weather-website.git
   cd weather-website
   ```  
2. (If required) Insert your API key inside `script.js` (or configuration file):  
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```  
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (or deploy using a static hosting service).  
4. Enter the name of a city in the search input and hit “Enter” or click the search icon. The weather information appears on the page.

## 🧪 Usage Tips  
- For best results, enter full city names. If multiple cities share the same name, include the country.  
- Ensure you have internet connectivity — the app depends on the external API.  
- On mobile, ensure screen width is sufficient or use in portrait mode for optimal layout.  
- If city's data doesn’t load, check API limits, city name spelling, or network connectivity.

## 🔧 Configuration & Deployment  
- To go live, host the site on a static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify or Vercel.  
- Optionally, extend the project to show hourly or weekly forecasts, map views, weather alerts, or integrate with device geolocation.  
- Consider adding caching for API results if usage or API‑quota is a concern.

## 👥 Contribution  
Contributions are welcome!  
- Fork the repo  
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)  
- Make your changes with descriptive commit messages  
- Push to your branch and open a Pull Request

## 📝 Future Enhancements  
- Add hourly & daily forecast views  
- Use device geolocation to detect user’s current location and show weather automatically  
- Display Air Quality Index (AQI), UV index and sunrise/sunset times  
- Add dark mode / light mode toggle  
- Refactor to a framework (React, Vue) or convert into a Progressive Web App (PWA)

## 🙏 Acknowledgements  
Thanks to all the open‑source libraries and APIs that make weather data accessible. Special thanks to the developers behind the weather API provider and those creating icon/GIF assets for weather conditions.
