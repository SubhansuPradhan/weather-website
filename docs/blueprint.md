## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#72BCD4) to evoke a sense of calm and clarity, reminiscent of a clear sky.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), a very desaturated shade of sky blue, to ensure comfortable readability and focus on weather information.
- Accent color: Pale orange (#FFAB91) for interactive elements, buttons, and highlights, providing a gentle contrast and signaling interactivity.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability on all devices. It provides a clean aesthetic suitable for displaying weather data.
- Use a set of flat, vector-based weather icons (sun, cloud, rain, snow) that match the color palette. Consistent and simple icons to improve at-a-glance understanding.
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Ensures content adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Subtle animations when loading weather data or transitioning between states. CSS transitions or minimal JavaScript animations to provide a polished user experience.
